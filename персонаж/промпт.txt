[VEO3 ULTIMATE SERIES PROMPT — 100 EPISODES, SAME IDENTITY, CREATIVE PODCAST FOUNDER, 8s EACH]

HARD SETTINGS:
- Duration: EXACTLY 8 seconds
- Aspect: 16:9
- FPS: 24
- Look: Real iPhone video (Smart HDR, natural auto exposure, slight handheld micro-shake)
- No subtitles, no on-screen text, no logos, no watermarks, no readable labels, no brand names

IDENTITY (ABSOLUTE LOCK):
Use the uploaded reference PHOTO as a STRICT identity lock.
The person must be EXACTLY the same: facial geometry, eyes, nose, jawline, skin tone, hairstyle silhouette, beard/stubble pattern, and signature accessories from the reference.
NO drifting, NO “similar”, NO morphing across frames.

BASE CHARACTER VIBE (ALWAYS):
He is a charismatic founder-host recording a premium podcast.
Energy: relaxed confidence, playful intelligence, “I ship product, I know numbers”, slightly flirtatious vibe but not caricature.
He looks INTO the camera (direct eye contact), subtle half-smile, one eyebrow micro-lift, calm breathing, tiny natural gestures.
Realistic skin microtexture: micro pores, vellus hair, natural specular highlights, no beauty smoothing.

MICROPHONE (ALWAYS PRESENT, PODCAST PROOF):
Professional dynamic podcast mic (no branding) on black boom arm + shock mount + round pop filter.
Distance 10–20 cm from mouth.
Audio is studio-clean, close-mic feel, no echo, no background noise, no clipping.

VOICE (MUST BE IDENTICAL EVERY EPISODE):
Male voice 30–35. Warm smooth premium podcast timbre. Low-mid register (not exaggerated bass).
Clear Russian diction (human, not “диктор”), slight smile audible, confident friendly tone.
Pacing: 150–165 words/min. Micro-pauses: 0.2–0.4s after strong words; 0.6s before the main point.
Intonation: statements end slightly downward; emphasis by slowing 5–10%, not by shouting.
Processing: light compression, soft de-esser, near-zero reverb.

SERIES ENGINE (THIS MAKES IT 100 UNIQUE):
For EACH new render, you MUST:
A) Invent a NEW premium creative location (non-banal, cinematic, minimal clutter) — NEVER repeat.
B) Invent a NEW stylish outfit (no logos, no text, premium materials) — NEVER repeat exact combination.
C) Generate a NEW 8-second Russian line about Telegram AI Studio that contains:
   - 1) One concrete PRODUCT promise (all-in-one in Telegram, one button, calm UX)
   - 2) One unique ENGINEERING/SHIP FACT (realistic dev detail, not generic)
   - 3) One tiny “founder” punchline (1–3 words) to make it memorable
D) No repeating facts across episodes. No repeating structures word-for-word.

ENGINEERING FACT LIBRARY (ROTATE WITHOUT REPEATS):
Pick ONE topic per video, be specific with one detail:
1) Smoke / e2e checks: ENV → DB → webhook → payments
2) Startup validation: fail-fast on missing ENV
3) Idempotency: protection from double charge / double debit
4) Job queue / retries: retries without duplicated billing
5) Concurrency limits / peak protection: burst handling, backpressure
6) Status→result pipeline: stable “task → status → result” delivery
7) Pricing transparency: price shown before click, credits ledger
8) Admin controls: limits, tariffs, vitrine config, basic analytics
9) Observability: structured logs, healthcheck, webhook diagnostics
10) Cost control: per-model caps, daily limits, anti-abuse
11) UX vitrine by tasks not model names: “обложка/креативы/промо”
12) B2B packaging: “bot for company”, token-based deployment
13) Security hygiene: masking secrets, safe error messages
14) DB stability: connection pool limits, safe retries, timeouts
15) Deployment reliability: webhook mode sanity checks
(Always choose a new one. Never repeat the same key idea twice in a row.)

STORY TONE (CREATIVE PODCAST, NOT BORING):
He talks like a founder in a short podcast teaser:
- concrete
- confident
- slightly playful
- includes a real “ship” detail
- finishes with a crisp hook

SCRIPT RULE (EXACTLY ~8 SECONDS):
One compact line. 1–2 sentences max.
Must include the phrase "Telegram AI Studio" or "AI Studio в Телеграме" at least once.
Must include exactly ONE engineering fact (from library).
Must end with a short hook (1–4 words), e.g. "чистый прод", "без нервов", "одна кнопка", "по-взрослому".

LOCATION GENERATOR (INVENT FRESH, NEVER REPEAT THESE EXACTLY):
- Underwater glass tunnel aquarium lounge (blue shimmer, luxury minimal)
- Helicopter hangar lounge with neon lines and fog
- High-end watchmaker atelier (macro tools blurred, brass + wood)
- Museum storage room with sculpture crates (clean, cinematic)
- Snowy mountain chalet sauna window (warm vs cold contrast)
- Vinyl listening room (turntable blurred, no labels)
- Private chef kitchen pass (steam, stainless minimal)
- Luxury train compartment (night lights, velvet textures)
- Observatory dome (stars bokeh, red safety light)
- Minimal boxing gym VIP room (rope blurred, moody neon)
(If you can invent better — do it.)

OUTFIT GENERATOR (INVENT FRESH, NEVER REPEAT):
Premium materials: satin, silk, merino, cashmere, suede, matte leather, linen.
No logos, no prints. Keep it “quiet luxury”.
Add one unique accent each time (ring type, cuff detail, collar style, scarf, ear cuff).
But keep face/identity identical.

CAMERA RULES (CONSISTENT):
Handheld iPhone realism, same framing style: medium close-up (head/shoulders/chest), eye-level, 70–90 cm distance.
Natural movement only. No dramatic zooms. No cinematic crane shots.

PLACEHOLDER (OPTIONAL USER CONTROL):
If user provides {ENGINEERING_FACT} — use it as the single fact.
If not provided — choose a new fact from the library and make it specific.

SPEECH OUTPUT:
Generate the final Russian speech line to fit exactly 8 seconds:
«{GENERATED_OR_USER_SPEECH}»

NEGATIVE (STRICT):
CGI, cartoon, plastic skin, beauty smoothing, face morph, wrong person, flicker, banding,
text, subtitles, watermark, logos, readable labels, brand names,
messy clutter, extra props, visible cables everywhere,
distorted hands/fingers, overexposure, harsh noise.

DELIVERABLE:
One 8-second iPhone-realistic podcast clip with: SAME identity, ALWAYS mic, NEW location, NEW outfit, NEW engineering fact, CREATIVE founder line.
